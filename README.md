# PokemoGo
pokemo can go anywhere, if i want it go

it works with Mac & Xcode10.3

first run "LocationSelect" with simulator,
when success,
close the Xcode,
and open the simulator which you run "LocationSelect";
and then run "freeLocation" in you Apple device/iPhone or iPad where you play pokemogo,
and then run "locateScript".

and now,
you just need to touch the map which show in your simulator,
where you mouse touched, the pokemo will go there.

At last, give all permissions, if the "LocationSelect"/"freeLocation"/"locateScript" asked.
